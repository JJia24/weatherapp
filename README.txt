A weather app produced for a FreeCodeCamp exercise as part of the Front End Development learning path. Uses HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery and Bootstrap.

Created to fulfil the following requirements:
1. I can see the weather at my current location.

2. I can see a different icon or background image (e.g. snowy mountain, hot desert) depending on the weather. (WIP)

3. I can push a button to toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius. (WIP)
